    <p class="paragraph1">Jay Wilson aka JaySun is a 45 year old California native that currently resides in Camden, NJ. since 2003.
    I wanted to create a website for the cratediggas that still listen to records, but they're not as internet savvy
    as other people who shop online to purchase records from a good quality hip-hop website or websites.  Making a 
    webpage, that provide cratediggas links to a specific online hip-hop record store of their choice to purchase records,
    is beneficial for them. Purchasing hip-hop records online in some instances is more convenient than physically going and
    searching for a certain record in your area. It saves time and gas money, but the drawback though for some cratediggas
    is waiting for the record or records to arrive via mail. I myself can be a little impatient when waiting for a record
    to arrive, but at least I know that a specific hip-hop record that I'm looking for is available online when it's not 
    available in the area I reside at.</p>
