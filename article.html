        <h2>Planet Asia & Apollo Brown - Sardines</h2>
        <p>After well received reviews from their first full-length album Anchovies, Planet Asia and Apollo Brown get together again for their second album Sardines. Produced entirely by Apollo Brown, Planet Asia proves as usual that he's a top tier lyricist/emcee in hip-hop. Listeners that happen to be into metaphysics and/or african spiriuality would appreciate the lyrical content he brings to the album as well. Standout songs to me are Panama Sun, Jungle Juice, Wizardry, Wide Awake, Peas & Onions and Can You Believe It.</p>

        <h2>Conway The Machine & 38 Spesh - Speshal Machinery</h2>
        <p>Some would argue that upstate New York artists like Griselda member Conway The Machine and Rochester native 38 Spesh is keeping New York relevant in hip-hop when its usually New York City. It's hard to argue against that when Conway and Spesh collaborate to release an album titled Speshal Machinery. 38 Spesh produced the album as well as rhymed with Conway. Standout songs include Latex Gloves featuring Lloyd Banks, Speshal Machinery, Fireplace, Goodfellas featuring Benny The Butcher, Unruly and We Outside featuring Pharoahe Monch and Che' Noir. </p>

        <h2>Real Bad Man & Blu - Bad News</h2>
        <p>Real Bad Man comes back with his latest edition of his collaborative albums, this time with Los Angeles native Blu with album Bad News. This album does not disappoint as the wordsmith Blu give his social commentary on L.A., the area he grew up in throughout this album. He also gives his perspective on life and religion/spiritualty on the album as well. Songs like Bad News, All Praise Due, Fall Of Rome, Hebrews featuring Planet Asia and More Bad News shows that Real Bad Man and Blu provide good chemistry. All though theres only 8 songs and some would consider this an EP, It's one of the best albums thats come out in 2023 in my opinion.

        <h2>Attention Readers</h2>
        <p>Every month expect to see three albums that will be featured in the article section. It's intended for artists who aren't popular in the mainstream media. Artists like Pharrell, Kanye West or Drake for example will not be in featured articles.</p>

<p class="remark">The one current trend that's in hip-hop right now is that artist is collaborating with one particular producer for an entire project. I think its great that artist from different regions of the country are collaborating with each other to make great music. The two artist thats mentioned in the featured article, Planet Asia and 38 Spesh, have collaborated together in the past and they still work together. This trend has been going on for awhile now it's nothing new, but I think its great for the culture since there was a time in hip-hop where the trend was a high-profile artist will get several producers to produce on their album.</p>
